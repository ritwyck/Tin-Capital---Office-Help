**Tin-Capital Office Automation Tools**
This project features two primary programs: a Dutch email classifier and a PDF editor.

*Dutch Email Classifier:* This program automates the sorting of investor responses into "Approved" or "Disapproved" categories, streamlining the workflow for faster decision-making.

*PDF Editor:* This tool serves as a temporary, local solution for editing PDFs. It enhances speed and keeps documents secure until they are transferred to an upcoming secure online service.

To ensure privacy and security, all files are neutralized to protect the sensitive information of all stakeholders. These tools can also be customized for specific use cases.

Feel free to reach out if you need any assistance or further customization!
